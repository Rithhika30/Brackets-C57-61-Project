        <h1>Hi! My name is Rithhika. Today I am going to tell you about my hobby which is playing Netball!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I Like to play Netball because it's an indoor sport and outdoor, so you can play it any time of the year, any time of day and it's a great social event where you can have fun with friends who are beginners and also friends that really know how to play. The better you get at netball, the more and more fun it is!When I get free time at school I play with my friends and also go to the netball clubs to improve. It makes me feel great and relaxed.</p>

        <h1>Renae Hallinan</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>Renae Hallinan,Australia/Adelaide Thunderbirds
            You have to understand netball to understand why Hallinan is such a great player. Hallinan is a dogged one-on-one defender who shuts down wing attacks, putting pressure on goal attacks to play two positions and leaving them unable to put up shots. Renae Hallinan (born 18 July 1986 in Melbourne, Australia) is an Australian international netballer. Primarily a wing-defence and centre player, Hallinan is a member of the Australian national team and plays in the ANZ Championship for the Adelaide Thunderbirds.</h2>
